## Known Limitations

- On some emails, the app will fail with `OutOfMemoryError` even with the maximum heap size set to 2GB. This occurs
  when the Gmail API client library unpacks the downloaded email in local memory using a third-party JSON library, which
  appears to sometimes make inefficient use of the available memory. If this happens, the original email will remain
  intact, the memory will be recovered, and the processing will continue with the next email.
